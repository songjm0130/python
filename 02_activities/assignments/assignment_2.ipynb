    "# Assignment #2: Efficacy Analysis of a Hypothetical Arthritis Drug\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: In this assignment, your task is to utilize Python programming skills to evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: Imagine a clinical trial where 60 patients were administered a new drug for arthritis. Data from this trial has been recorded in a series of CSV files. Evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure**:\n",
    "- Each CSV file corresponds to a specific check-in session with the patients.\n",
    "- There are 12 such CSV files, reflecting 12 different sessions where patients reported their experiences.\n",
    "- Inside each file:\n",
    "  - Rows: Each of the 60 rows represents a unique patient.\n",
    "  - Columns: Each of the 40 columns corresponds to a day, detailing the number of inflammation flare-ups the patient experienced on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Role**: Analyze this data to determine how effective the new drug has been in managing arthritis inflammation across the trial period."

    "\n",
    "Your next step is to create a function named `patient_summary` that will compute summary statistics for each patient's data over a 40-day period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Specifications**:\n",
    "- **Function Name**: `patient_summary`\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  1. `file_path`: A string representing the path to the CSV file containing the patient data.\n",
    "  2. `operation`: A string specifying the type of summary operation to perform. Acceptable values are \"mean\", \"max\", or \"min\". This will determine whether the function calculates the average, maximum, or minimum number of flare-ups for each patient over the 40 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Behavior**:\n",
    "- Your function should read the data from the file at `file_path`.\n",
    "- Perform the specified `operation` (mean, max, or min) to summarize the flare-ups data for each of the 60 patients.\n",
    "- Return an array with 60 elements, each element being the result of the summary operation for a corresponding patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "- The output should be an array with a length of 60, aligning with the number of patients in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints for Implementation**:\n",
    "1. **Utilizing NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and computation, consider using NumPy, as discussed in the `10_numpy` slides.\n",
